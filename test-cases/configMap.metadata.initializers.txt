RESOURCE: initializers <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     An initializer is a controller which enforces some system invariant at
     object creation time. This field is a list of initializers that have not
     yet acted on this object. If nil or empty, this object has been completely
     initialized. Otherwise, the object is considered uninitialized and is
     hidden (in list/watch and get calls) from clients that haven't explicitly
     asked to observe uninitialized objects. When an object is created, the
     system will populate this list with the current set of initializers. Only
     privileged users may set or modify this list. Once it is empty, it may not
     be modified further by any user. DEPRECATED - initializers are an alpha
     field and will be removed in v1.15.

     Initializers tracks the progress of initialization.
